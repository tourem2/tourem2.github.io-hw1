  <p>As a software engineer in this day and age, I find that many difficulties arise from the many changes and innovations made within the industry itself. One of those difficulties is keeping up with these changes by constantly learning new and advanced methods and techniques, surrounding yourself with the younger generation that seems to be actively learning or just having a mindset adaptable to change. Nevertheless, I believe this is all challenging for one, not because of change itself (in fact, in any industry change is necessary), but because of how quick these changes occur which gives no time to programmers to prepare themselves. This is why I chose to focus on "Your Knowledge Portfolio" as it is one of the hardest to maintain out of all the topics of Pragmatic Philosophy.</p>
  
  <p>Another topic that stood out to me was "Communication". In software engineering, the collaboration of a team is very much needed as one person does not have all the knowledge and the team's efforts to gather ideas from each other is usually what gets the job done. Of course communication a lot more than just speaking, but knowing what exactly to say, how to say it, questioning whether it's important or relevant to the discussion and just being an overall good listener. Furthermore, I believe building a relationship with your team members is necessary because it facilitates the communication between one another. </p>
